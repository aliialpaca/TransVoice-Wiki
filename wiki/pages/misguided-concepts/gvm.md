# Godamoto Voice Masochism
{: .no_toc }

**Godamoto Voice Masochism**, or **GVM**, was an experimental voice experiment conducted in January-February 2021 by Godamoto, a person very active in the community during 2020-2021, in order to investigate whether the intentional indiscriminate excess engagement and straining of the musculature surrounding the mouth and throat area (loosely targeting primarily the extrinsic laryngeal musculature) would bring any increase to meta-resonance, facilitated via swallow-and-hold while looking at the ceiling.

The experiment upon completion was considered a complete failure, with only negligible increases in meta-resonance at the cost of intense pain, sweating and strain on the musculature. It is considered a prime (and extreme) example as to why swallow-and-hold and related exercises are ineffective and potentially dangerous. It is **strongly recommended not to attempt this for any reason**.

## Background

The idea of GVM came as a result of a discovery during a voice workshop led by Hearth (a trans voice teacher), where it was found a student (known for her exceptionally high meta-resonance and light vocal weight) had induced muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) of – including, but not limited to – the stylohyoid muscles[^recordings]. She had used swallow-and-hold exercises to voice train for several years which lead to constant involuntary contraction of such musculature[^memory]. She had ended up using this as there were no better widespread methods developed at the time; it was more effective than the classical voice pedagogy derived methods, and so many casual voice feminisation videos of the time essentially endorsed this sort of training method.

Among other symptoms, she was found to not be able to properly yawn due to constant involuntary contraction of these muscles (which typically lowers meta-resonance due to expansion of muscles in the oropharynx). <!-- (which ones?) -->

After some discussion amongst some attendees of the workshop, which included Godamoto, he and others wondered if the reason this student had an exceptional voice was due to her long-term use of swallow-and-hold and the resulting muscular constriction of the stylohyoid (and other musculature).

## Experiment

The hypothesis of the experiment was to find out whether intentionally inducing general sustained strain on the musculature around the larynx would lead to any significant increase in meta-resonance. This was facilitated via swallowing-and-holding while looking at the ceiling.

The method was to maintain at least 30 minutes of consistent indiscriminate engagement of the musculature in the throat and mouth (facilitated by swallowing and holding while looking upward towards the ceiling), unless significantly high levels of lingering strain ended up prevalent outside of the activity period of the experiment.

The experiment was conducted over approximately 9 days (however, temporary breaks were taken during this period), during which daily observations and notes were made. Additionally, the daily duration of prolonged engagement, the levels of strain, general perceived locations of strain, and maximum overall maintainable F1 frequency were recorded, along with audio recordings and spectrogram screenshots. Formants were measured via a spectrogram and the InFormant voice analysis software.

## Results

As a result of carrying out the experiment, Godamoto reported[^spreadsheet]:

*   During engagement; intense pain, reported description of throat feeling on fire, sweating
*   Outside of engagement; a general persisting low to moderate level of strain, which increased over time
*   A slight, but mostly negligible, increase in meta-resonance (although this increase may have been incidental and attributable to other factors)
*   Numbness and an inability to proprioceptively locate the larynx, having to resort to feeling it with the hand
*   Increase in ease of access to a feminine voice configuration after 2 days
*   His voice sounding noticeably strained after 3 days
*   A decrease in stylohyoid flexibility
*   Excess engagement and strain of the lower and side chin areas (suspected engaged musculature include the mylohyoids) and lower sections of the larynx
*   Slight discomfort while chewing after 6 days
*   Induced clicking larynx syndrome[^memory]

The experiment was considered a complete failure. After the 6th day (after input from voice teachers[^discord]) it was intended to modify the experiment to not indiscriminately strain as many muscles as possible in the entire throat and mouth region, and to focus on amount of swallows rather than duration of swallowing. However, this was never tried.

## Additional thoughts

Excessive engagement of the extrinsic laryngeal musculature leads a strong risk of bringing tension to the intrinsic laryngeal musculature, which can, among many other things, easily lead to false fold engagement[^ptj20130547]. This may be the reason why Godamoto developed an audibly strained voice after a couple of days.

Raising of the larynx is not the only factor that increases meta-resonance. There are other involved factors, such as tongue positioning (aside from the root of the tongue, which is connected to the larynx via the hyoid bone and so inevitably raises when the larynx is raised).

Swallowing is a complex process that involves many different muscles not necessarily linked directly to the elevation of the larynx \[give examples\]. Additionally, the generalised focus on excessive indiscriminate constriction of the laryngeal region inevitably lead to indiscriminate straining of many different extrinsic laryngeal muscles not necessarily needed to attain high meta-resonance.

There is also something to be said about the excessive focus on meta-resonance that the experiment had, considering that the community and pedagogy in their evolution have as of recent begun to consider the _relationship_ between different aspects of the voice and as parts of a whole, rather than overly isolated aspects of the voice. For example, TransVoiceLesson's more recent pedagogy talks about _overfull_ and _underfull_, which focuses on the relation between size (meta-resonance) and vocal weight.
